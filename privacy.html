provide any of the information we have collected from you in

City&rsquo;s businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you
are. Or, we might allow Advertisers to display their ads to users
with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage
information to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a
manner that would identify you personally. Note that if an advertiser
asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and
you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the
description of the audience they were trying to reach. Sometimes
SAnime conducts advertising campaigns on third party websites and
applications (e.g., Facebook) (collectively, &ldquo;Third Party

in personally identifiable form to the operators of the Third Party
Platforms solely to allow them to direct our advertising content to
